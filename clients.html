            Believe few words can better describe the value and contribution of
            this exercice which is another step in our journey and focus on building
            an injury-free environment and culture in our plants : not doing more
            but better, strenghten motication from plant management to the shop
            flor, raising safety awareness and looking for new opportunities,
            understanding our roles and responsabilities on risks assessments,
            value of safety and understanding ways to improve conditions and
            behaviors.
