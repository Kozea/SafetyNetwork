                Believe few words can better describe the value and contribution of
                this exercice which is another step in our journey and focus on building
                an injury-free environment and culture in our plants : not doing more
                but better, strenghten motication from plant management to the shop
                flor, raising safety awareness and looking for new opportunities,
                understanding our roles and responsabilities on risks assessments,
                value of safety and understanding ways to improve conditions and
                behaviors."

                "In a very specific cultural context in terms of safety,
                SafetyNetwork helped us to evolve from a disciplinary
                driven approach to one of Management. Through the
                involvement of all levels in the company, the
                implementation of suitable field tools and appropriate
                communication channels, we have reduced our injury
                rate by almost 95% allowing us now to aim for "zero
                accidents"."
